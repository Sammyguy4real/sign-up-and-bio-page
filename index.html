        <p>
            I am Samuel Ajayi, a 300-level student of Political Science at the University of Ibadan. I am a Software Engineering student at AltSchool Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
            My tech journey can be traced back to when I was a kid (maybe everyone can relate, haha) when I was the go-to person to resolve any issue my mum or stepfather was facing with their phone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Few weeks out of secondary in 2017, I found myself in a Cybercafe, alone in a cubicle trying to learn how to operate a computer over Fashion design, which I later learnt three years later (story for another day.. haha). The four months of experience introduced me to blogging, web development and lots more which I just realized their purpose recently. I invested most of my time in plagiarising from Naijaloaded, Tooxclusive, Waploaded and others for my blog.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this period,  I developed interet in building web development which prompted my eagerness to learn to create a website using Wordpress,blogger & wix.
